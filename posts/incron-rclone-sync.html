  <h1>incron and rclone for syncing screenshots to google drive on linux</h1>
  <p>
    I frequently take screenshots in my laptop & use them to recall 
    what I had read and worked on (kind of like Anki notes). I wanted to automatically 
    sync my screenshots to google-drive to look at my laptop screenshots on my phone when I am on the go.
  </p>

  <p>
    Since ubuntu automatically stores screenshots in <code>Pictures</code> folder,
    To automatically watch for new file creation in Pictures folder I used <code>incron</code>(<b>i</b>node <b>n</b>otify <b>cron</b>) 
    and to sync them to google-drive I used <code>rclone</code>.
  </p>

  <ul>

    <li>
      To set-up rclone for google-drive, refer to instructions at <a href="https://rclone.org/drive/">rclone.org/drive/</a>.
    </li>
    <li>
      To setup incrontab, refer to instructions 
      <a href="https://www.howtoforge.com/tutorial/trigger-commands-on-file-or-directory-changes-with-incron/">here</a>
      <br>
      In short, 
      <pre><code>$ incrontab -e</code></pre>
      Add the following line
      <pre><code>/home/jkl/Pictures IN_CREATE /usr/bin/rclone sync /home/jkl/Pictures google:photos</code></pre>
    </li>
  </ul>
